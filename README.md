# Advent of code 2019 - clojure

My solutions to advent of code 2019 :rocket:

The goal is to complete the challenges in clojure. But since I'm a rookie at clojure, and since I want to brush up on my python, I'll implement them in python first. 

Python solutions in jupyter notebooks in folders `01`, ..., `25`. Input files in the same folders. Clojure solutions in `clj/main.clj` for now, will probably split them up later on.
